## php-netflix

This is an unofficial crawler that can retrieve the Netflix viewing history 
for the given username/password. You should note that you can't request and 
call this too often otherwise you'll lock your Netflix account for a short 
period as they think you're trying to register more devices than your plan 
allows.
